EMBT is a core Embedded Sytems Design Course which prepare us for future in Embedded technology. In first 3 semesters, we learned about various theoretical aspects of Embedded Engineering and Design techniques. 
In 3rd semester, in ESE_3025 , we learned about real time operating systems and in ESE_3005,we learned about embedded systems architecture, LPC1769 board and MCUExpresso, various architectures such as mutex etc.Thus, we have learned about BBB and in 3014 ,we learned about various communication protocols and how to implement them with BBB to communicate with various devices. 
In term 4, we will make use of all the software and hardware skills in Capstone project. Our central device will be BB Wireless and we will make use of some real time problems in order to make a project which can tackle these issues to some extent.
In Term 4, we are going to design an IoT based smart restauranrt food ordering menu using Beaglebone black wireless.
Smart Restaurant food ordering menu using Beaglebone black.

15) Smoke and LPG gas sensor (MQ-2)
16) Mct2e optocoupler
17) Buzzer
18)  Wire cutter
19) Wire stripper
20) 12v DC Fan
21) Power supply

**Testing hardware components:
After buying all hardware, first step is to test it so that we can use it in our project with no second thoughts. 

**So, I was assigned a task to test following components:

Arduino Uno: I tested Arduino Uno with blinking LED code avilable in Arduino IDE and also researched about Arduino IDE

20* 2 LCD module : For testing of LCD, I interfaced LCD module to Arduino Uno and imported I2C library to IDE and tested an example code from library

4.3" Nextion Touch display module: For testing of touch module, I created a simple GUI using Nextion editor and then in order to show data transfer between Arduino and touch LCD, 
I imported a code to Arduino IDE and uploaded it to Touch module and it worked properly.

Smoke sensor-MQ-2 : Testing of smoke sensor is done by interfacing it with arduino

CO sensor-MQ-9 : It is also interfaced to Arduino in order to do testing.

Magnetic Buzzer: Buzzer is also tested using a simple delay program in Arduino IDE

SIM900 GSM Module :I interfaced GSM Module to Arduino but it was not able to detect network , so testing was not completed.

I was able to test all components succesfully except GSM module. 

Next Task:
My task is about interfacing of touch screen dsiplay with Beaglebone Black Wireless.
